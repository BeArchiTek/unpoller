# Grafana Dashboards & Examples

This folder contains 3 grafana dashboards to get you started with the new data pool.
Import these into Grafana to quickly visualize data from your devices.
Created with Grafana 6.2.

They require a few plugins: `Clock`, `Discrete`, `Singlestat`, `Table`

Keep in mind these dashboards are just examples. You should make an Example folder
in Grafana to keep them in, and copy them to new dashboards that you want to change.
From time to time I will release new features (like multi-site support) that brings
new benefits to the existing dashboards. When that happens I update them.
Keeping an Example set allows you to update too, inspect the changes, and apply them
to your own custom dashboards.

This folder also contains an example configuration file and some dashboard screenshots.
