# Grafana Dashboards & Examples

This folder contains 4 grafana dashboards to get you started with the new data pool.
Import these into Grafana to quickly visualize data from your devices.
Created with Grafana 6.2.

These dashboards require a few plugins.
See the [Grafana Wiki Article](https://github.com/davidnewhall/unifi-poller/wiki/Grafana) for more info.

Keep in mind these dashboards are just examples. You should make an Example folder
in Grafana to keep them in, and copy them to new dashboards that you want to change.
From time to time I will release new features (like multi-site support) that brings
new benefits to the existing dashboards. When that happens I update them.
Keeping an Example set allows you to update too, inspect the changes, and apply them
to your own custom dashboards.

This folder also contains dashboard screenshots and example configuration files in four supported formats.
You can use any format you want for the config file, just give it the appropriate prefix for the format.
ie. an xml file should end with `.xml`.
