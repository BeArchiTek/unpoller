# Grafana Dashboards & Examples

This folder used to contain Grafana Dashboards.

**They are now located at [Grafana.com](https://grafana.com/dashboards?search=unifi-poller).** More info is available on The [Grafana Dashboards Wiki Page](https://github.com/davidnewhall/unifi-poller/wiki/Grafana-Dashboards).

Keep in mind these dashboards are just examples. You should make an Example folder
in Grafana to keep them in, and copy them to new dashboards that you want to change.
From time to time I will release new features (like multi-site support) that brings
new benefits to the existing dashboards. When that happens I update them.
Keeping an Example set allows you to update too, inspect the changes, and apply them
to your own custom dashboards.

This folder also contains dashboard screenshots and example configuration files in four supported formats.
You can use any format you want for the config file, just give it the appropriate suffix for the format.
ie. an xml file should end with `.xml`.
