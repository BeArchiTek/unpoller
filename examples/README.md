# Examples

This folder contains example configuration files in four
supported formats. You can use any format you want for
the config file, just give it the appropriate suffix for
the format. A JSON file should end with `.json`, and
YAML with `.yaml`. The default format is always TOML and
may have any _other_ suffix.
